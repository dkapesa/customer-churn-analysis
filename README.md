Key Findings
Overall churn rate: ~26%.

Higher churn among month-to-month contract customers, fiber optic internet users, and customers with high monthly charges.

Financial factors (Monthly Charges, Total Charges) and service-related factors (contract type, internet service) are critical churn predictors.

Business Recommendations
Offer loyalty discounts to high-risk customers.

Improve onboarding processes to reduce early-stage churn.

Encourage longer-term contracts with service bundling and incentives.

Tools Used
SQL (BigQuery in Google Colab)

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Google Colab

GitHub

Future Improvements
Incorporate customer satisfaction survey data.

Build time-series models to capture churn over time.

Develop a real-time churn prediction dashboard.
